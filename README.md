I implemented a java nio application which communicate over network. In the server side, I build a simple NIO server which accept connection request from client side.
After connection request accepted, a number between 0-9 randomly generated. This number will be compared with the value which is sent by the client.
After connection is opened, user send a number between 0-9. Client get response for the numbers.
